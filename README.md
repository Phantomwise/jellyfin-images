# Phantomwise's Custom Images for Jellyfin

This is a repo containing my custom images for Jellyfin.

I didn't make the background of those images, I only modified them to add text and effects.

The XCF folder contains the Gimp files, you can edit them yourself if you want to change the text. They were made with Gimp 3, I am not sure how compatible they would be with older versions of Gimp.

The repo does not contains all my custom Jellyfin images, only those based on images that have a license allowing free use, modification and redistribution. Attributions and licenses for each image are in a file named `imagename-ATTRIBUTION-and-LICENSE.txt` located in the same place as the image. The modified version always keeps the original license because I don't want the headache of figuring which are share-alike and which aren't and of finding a new license compatible with the old one.

Details about the fonts used are in the README of the relevant folder.

The images that are not in the repo were made with random images found online whose license is unknown, which is why I couldn't upload them ðŸ˜¢
